        <h2>Research Methods</h2>
        <h3>Remote Sensing and Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Our research leverages remote sensing data from multiple satellite
          missions, processed primarily through Google Earth Engine (GEE). We
          retrieve environmental variables such as temperature (MODIS
          MYD21A1D/N), precipitation (GPM v6), soil moisture (SMAP), and
          humidity (AIRS) for the NWN2 trap site and other locations in Oklahoma
          from April 2018 to November 2023. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data are
          used to generate monthly land cover maps via Random Forest
          classification, identifying features like open water, inundated
          vegetation, and forested areas.
        </p>
        <h3>Ecological Modeling</h3>
        <p>
          General Linear Models (GLMs) are developed using R to explore
          correlations between mosquito abundance and environmental variables
          (e.g., air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture). In-situ data
          from the Oklahoma Mesonet, including weekly averages for temperature,
          humidity, and solar radiation, are cross-validated with remote sensing
          data. A one-way ANOVA is used to compare datasets, ensuring model
          accuracy.
        </p>
        <h3>Google Colab Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Google Colab serves as our central platform for data processing,
          integrating GEE scripts with Python for analysis. Our <a
            href="https://colab.research.google.com/"
            target="_blank">Colab notebook</a
          > (placeholder link) allows users to specify date ranges, buffer zones
          (1 km radius around trap sites), and environmental parameters, generating
          visualizations like NDVI bar graphs and time series charts.
