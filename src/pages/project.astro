        <h2>Project: Mosquito-Borne Disease Prediction</h2>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to develop a mosquito-borne disease risk model for central
          Oklahoma using in situ and spaceborne remote sensing data. The model
          identifies environmental variables and land cover characteristics that
          predict mosquito abundance, with applications to other regions like
          Costa Rica’s Talamanca Mountains. See our <a href="/methods"
            >methods</a
          > for details on data processing.
        </p>
        <h3>Team</h3>
        <p>
          Our team consists of six SNU undergraduate students, mentored by Dr.
          Caio França (SNU) and Dr. Erika Podest (NASA JPL). Students are
          organized into three Focus Groups to tackle different aspects of the
          research. Meet the team on our <a href="/team">team page</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Focus Groups</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus Group I: In-Situ Correlations</strong> - Analyzes mosquito
            abundance against in-situ variables (e.g., Mesonet data: temperature,
            precipitation, soil moisture). Incorporates land cover from Focus Group
            II to develop and validate a model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus Group II: Land Cover Classification</strong> - Generates
            monthly land cover maps using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data in Google
            Earth Engine, employing Random Forest classification to support correlation
            analyses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus Group III: Remote Sensing Correlations</strong> - Explores
            mosquito abundance with satellite data (e.g., MODIS, GPM, SMAP), comparing
            results with Focus Group I to refine risk indicators.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <p>We are investigating key questions, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How do environmental drivers affect mosquito composition between
            early and late seasons?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do species-specific responses differ from community-wide responses
            to environmental variables?
          </li>
          <li>
            How do spatial and temporal variations influence mosquito abundance
            and species richness?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are sites within the same land cover associated with different
            species richness, and if so, why?
          </li>
          <li>Does previous-year rainfall impact mosquito abundance?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Preliminary findings will be shared on our <a href="/findings"
            >findings page</a
          > as they become available.
        </p>
        <h3>Application</h3>
        <p>
          The developed model and workflow will be applied to additional trap
          sites in another location and/or Costa Rica to test its usability,
          enhancing public health strategies for disease mitigation.
